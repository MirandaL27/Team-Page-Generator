# Team Page Generator

# Description
The purpose of this project is to generate a styled html page based on the employee information given by the user.  It enabled me to practice capturing user input from inquirer, apply object oriented design principles with classes and ineritence, and write HTML and design HTML elements with CSS. 

# Built With
* Node.js
* Inquirer

# Features
* The program starts by asking users for information about the manager.
